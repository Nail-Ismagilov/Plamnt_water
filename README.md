###  This is a code for watering system.
###  The Project is made on Arduino UNO platform based on ATMega328P.
###  An LCD display connected to the UNO platform indicating a dryness level of 4 different plants soil, Temperature and Humidity in the room where the plant is.
###  The code can be used in cooperation with following hardware system:
###  
###  - 1x Screen LCD1602 Module
###  - 1x DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Module
###  - 4x Soil Moisture Sensor Module

###  The code can be expand for autonomus watering, by adding to the system a water pump.
