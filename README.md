# Plant_watering_Machine
Arduino Project

Thisi is a code for watering system.
The Project is made on Arduino UNO platform based on ATMega328P.
An LCD display connected to the UNO platform indicating a dryness level of 4 different plants soil, Temperature and Humidity in the room where the plant is.
The code can be used in cooperation with following hardware system:

- 1x Screen LCD1602 Module
- 1x DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Module
- 4x Soil Moisture Sensor Module

The code can be expand for autonomus watering, by adding to the system a water pump.
